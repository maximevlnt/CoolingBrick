## **Usage Scenarios**  

### **1. Indoor Applications**  

#### **Passive Indoor Furniture**  
A portable and autonomous piece of furniture that captures humidity in ventilated environments.  
- **Utility:** Eco-friendly, energy-free operation, suitable for domestic spaces.  
- **Use Case:** Place the furniture outside at night to capture humidity and coolness, then use it indoors during the day in an airflow.  

#### **Ventilated and Humidified Indoor Furniture**  
Addition of a mechanical ventilation and humidification system.  
- **Utility:** Increased efficiency in dry or poorly ventilated spaces.  
- **Use Case:** Humidity and cooling control in a room (bedroom, office).  

#### **Interior Wall**  
A partition made of bricks separating indoor spaces.  
- **Utility:** Moderate thermal improvement indoors with an aesthetic role.  
- **Use Case:** Partition between a veranda and a room or in a living room.

### **2. Outdoor Applications**  

#### **Terrace Wall**  
An exterior wall that captures nighttime humidity and coolness to cool a terrace during the day.  
- **Utility:** Passive and autonomous solution adapted to outdoor spaces.  
- **Use Case:** Well-oriented wall on a terrace to improve thermal comfort.  

#### **Passive Public Space Wall (Train/Bus)**  
A wall installed in public outdoor waiting areas, optimized to maximize airflow and provide natural cooling.  
- **Utility:** Thermal comfort in highly exposed environments.  
- **Use Case:** Shelter for buses or train stations in urban areas.  

#### **Humidified Public Space Wall**  
A wall equipped with a rainwater collection system to maintain an optimal humidity level.  
- **Utility:** Constant cooling, even during the day.  
- **Use Case:** Parks or public squares to create "cool islands."

## **Conclusion: General Limitations**  
- **Dependence on Environmental Conditions:** Low humidity or reduced ventilation decrease performance.  
- **Aesthetic and Architectural Constraints:** Requires seamless integration into spaces.  
- **Installation and Maintenance:** Versions connected to a water source or mechanical systems increase cost, weight, and complexity.  
- **Specific Climate Conditions:** Optimal performance in humid and ventilated environments.
